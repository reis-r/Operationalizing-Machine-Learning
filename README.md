# Operationalizing Machine Learning

This project was made as part of the Udacity Nanodegree on Machine Learning Engineering with Microsoft Azure. It consists on deploying a model in production, using monitoring tools to evaluate the deploy and building a deployment pipeline based on continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) principles.

For the experiments, an AutoML model was trained based on the Bank Marketing dataset provided by Udacity. After the deployment of the trained AutoML model, we enable logging via Application Insights. After deployment, we benchmark the model endpoint and build the Swagger documentation for the HTTP API created. Then we consume the endpoint and build a pipeline endpoint for AutoML.
