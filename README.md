# Operationalizing Machine Learning

This project was made as part of the Udacity Nanodegree on Machine Learning Engineering with Microsoft Azure. It consists on deploying a model in production, using monitoring tools to evaluate the deploy and building a deployment pipeline based on continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) principles.

For the experiments, an AutoML model was trained based on the Bank Marketing dataset provided by Udacity. After the deployment of the trained AutoML model, we enable logging via Application Insights. After deployment, we benchmark the model endpoint and build the Swagger documentation for the HTTP API created. Then we consume the endpoint and build a pipeline endpoint for AutoML.

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
